# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to classify the credit card transactions into normal and fraudulent. By applying the SMOTE over-sampling approach, I attempted to balancing the [European credit card fraud dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). I have experimented with three machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost. Finally, XGBoost and Random Forest models have provided us with the best results as ability to find out more than 80% fraud transactions and not classifying a lot of non-fraud transactions as fraud.
